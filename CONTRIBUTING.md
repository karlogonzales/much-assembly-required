## Before creating a pull request

Here small unordered list of guidelines to read before creating a pull request
- Use java <= 1.8 features
- Please follow [Google's Java style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html)
- Constants (e.g. the energy cost of an in-game action) should be loaded from config.properties
- The project is separated into multiple modules, the `Server` module and its plugins. Plugins should 
not depend on another plugin to compile or to run.
(e.g. NPC plugin shouldn't import `net.simon987.biomassplugin` )
- Use `Logmanager.LOGGER`Â to log messages to the console. Use `.fine()` for debugging messages and `.info()` for 
info for more important messages 
that are not too frequently used.
- Do not submit a pull request for a new feature that has not been approved 
by [simon987](https://github.com/simon987) in an Issue beforehand
- Please state what tests have been performed in the pull request
